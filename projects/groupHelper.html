  <p>In team environments, it can be difficult to balance the amount of work between the individual members,
      and ensure that everyone in the group is comfortable with the current dynamic. 
      Having a face to face conversation with other members of the team can be useful, 
      but social pressures can make it difficult accurately communicate how the individuals in the group are feeling. 
      This breakdown in communication can lead to a team that doesnâ€™t function at its full potential due to internal conflict and inefficiency.
