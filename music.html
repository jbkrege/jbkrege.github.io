<b>History</b><br>
I have studied music since I was six years old, when I began taking violin lessons.
When I was thirteen I began playing piano.
In middle and high school I played bass in the orchetra.
By the age of sixteen I had taught myself ukulele and guitar as well.
As a senior in high school I auditioned to be part of the bass performance program at Northwestern and was accepted.
Currently I am studying Music Technology at Northwestern.<br>
