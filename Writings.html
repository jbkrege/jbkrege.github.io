    This is a place that I write about things that interest me. <br>
    I love to read, study world religions, and listen to music absolutely constantly so I'll probably post about that stuff a good bit.
    I'm trying to add around one post a week so be ready, world! <br>
    Although I dont like to post on <a href = 'https://medium.com/@jbkrege'>Medium<a> I do love to read stuff on it.

  <h2>
    Pre-1980's Foundations for Automatic Composition 
  </h2>
  <p>
    I'm fascinated by the concept of using computers to aid composition.
    This is an essay I wrote on the potential of algorithmic music from the Illiac Suite (1950s) to David Cope in 1983.
    This field is currently exploding and I'm super excited about it.
