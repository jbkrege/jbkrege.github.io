      <a href = https://github.com/curtywang/laserharp>Laser Harp</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am particularly excited about this project because it lies at the intersection of two of my most driving interests, music and design.
      I'm working with Northwestern's chapter of IEEE to develop a laser harp that combines the functionality of a laser harp with
      that of a LaunchPad, an array of buttons commonly used by electronic musicians, to turn a performance effect
      into a versitile instrument for live performance. Click the title to see the repository.

    <p>
      This calculator is the first project in Northwestern's EECS 330, Human Computer Interaction.
      Currently just front end, but functionality should be added by next week.

      Group Helper
    </h2>
    <p>
      In team environments, it can be difficult to balance the amount of work between the individual members,
      and ensure that everyone in the group is comfortable with the current dynamic. 
      Having a face to face conversation with other members of the team can be useful, 
      but social pressures can make it difficult accurately communicate how the individuals in the group are feeling. 
      This breakdown in communication can lead to a team that doesnâ€™t function at its full potential due to internal conflict and inefficiency.
      <br><br>
      For the final project of EECS 330, my team is designing a web application that helps groups manage themselves to maximise their
      effectiveness.
