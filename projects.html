    </h2>
    <p>
      I am particularly excited about this project because it lies at the intersection of two of my most driving interests, music and design.
      I'm working with Northwestern's chapter of IEEE to develop a laser harp that combines the functionality of a laser harp with
      that of a LaunchPad, an array of buttons commonly used by electronic musicians, to turn a performance effect
      into a versitile instrument for live performance. Click the title to see the repository.

      This calculator is the first project in Northwestern's EECS 330, Human Computer Interaction. Some fun with CSS.
